<b>Topic Do Patents Promote or Prevent Progress?</b> <br><i>Jeffrey A Meldman, Associate Dean, Senior Lecturer, and Director of Undergraduate Programs at Sloan.</i>

<br>
The U.S. Constitution empowers the granting of federal patents in order to
promote the progress of technology.  Recent fears have arisen as to whether
the granting of patents pertaining to software, business methods, and
genetic materials may actually prevent, rather than promote, progress in
these fields.  Much of this fear stems from an imprecise understanding of
what patents protect and what they do not.  We will look carefully at the
requirements and limitations of patent rights to see how these have been
designed to let patents achieve their Constitutional purpose.

<br><b>Sustainable Energy Supply Options for the 21st Century</b><br><i>
Jefferson W Tester, HP Meissner Professor of Chemical Engineering, Director of Energy Lab</i><br>
To develop alternative non-fossil energy technologies in the next century on a scale where they would have substantive impact globally, where over 350 quads of energy annually will require high performance, low costs, and aggressive development strategies.  In today's energy markets, a diverse set of energy services are needed to satisfy demands for stationary and mobile applications requiring both thermal and electricity spread over the building, transportation, and industrial sectors.  Furthermore, overall performance of any new technology must be comparable to or exceed what is currently provided by fossil fuels.  Choosing from a suite of options is complicated by inherent barriers to change as well as the site-specific quality characteristics of many new energy technologies.  For example, the availability and quality of solar isolation, of geothermal heat, of wind, or of land for biomass play critical roles in determining viability of a particular technology.

<br><b>Technology in the classroom, and other educational inputs: What really works?</b><i><br>
Prof. Josh Angrist
</i><br>


The question of how technology affects learning has been at the center of recent debates over educational inputs.  In 1994, the Israeli State Lottery sponsored the installation of computers in many elementary and middle schools.  This program provides an opportunity to estimate the impact of computerization on both the instructional use of computers and on pupils= test scores.  Data from this Anatural experiment@ suggest that computer-aided instruction had a major impact on the way teachers teach.  But computer-aided instruction did not translate into higher test scores, and may have even reduced mathematics achievement among 4th graders.  So what can be done to improve our schools?  Evidence from a number of earlier experiments, natural and otherwise, suggests that traditional inputs such as reduced class size and better teacher training, are much more likely to be cost-effective than education technology.
