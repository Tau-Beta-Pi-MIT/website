This is the opening lecture of the Spring 1999 series of dinners.  As such, refreshments will be served instead of the full course dinner.  This lecture will be open to everyone.<br>
<i>Drug Discovery - From Serendipity to Rational Design in the Hands of Chemists</i><br>        
&#147;From Chinese herbal medicines to modern antibiotics and anticancer drugs, serendipity has played a key role in identifying pharmaceuticals.  But only one in ten-thousand compounds evaluated by random screening ever makes it through clinical trials.  Can we do better?  This seminar addresses the question by examining the case study of cisplatin, a platinum-containing anticancer drug that has virtually eradicated testicular cancer and is showing great promise to do the same for cervical cancer.  The desire to design drugs by rational methods has driven chemists for decades to probe the workings of the cell and use the power of synthesis to help improve the human condition.  It would appear that we are getting close, as modern chemistry provides the tools to make the dream a reality.

<i>The Remarkable Properties of Carbon Nanotubes</i><br>        
&#147; A brief overview, interspersed with anecdotes, will be given of
 the remarkable structural and  electronic properties of carbon
nanotubes, which are tiny structures of molecular dimensions in the
 form of hollow cylinders with about 20 carbon atoms around the
 circumference of the cylinders.
The unique electronic properties of these carbon nanotubes are that they
can be either semiconducting or metallic depending on their geometry.
 Potential practical electronic applications of 
nanotubes will also be considered.

<br><i>The Search for Pristinee Rivers:  the Science and some Adventures in Eastern Siberia, Western China and Tibet</i><br>

&#147;Being interested in the processes that control the chemistry of large uncontaminated rivers as part of a very long-term project on The Earth as a Chemical System, Professor Edmond will talk about his work, and adventures, in the Amazon, Orinoco, Eastern siberia and Western China.  This will be a combination of environmental chemistry and travelogue.&#148; by John Edmond, Professor of marine Geochemistry and Paleoceanography.

<br><i>Sustainable Development and the End of Man</i><br>

&#147;Professor Trout will present an overview of sustainable development with a particular emphasis on emission of greenhouse gases and the debate on global climate warming.  His intention is for the presentation to be a stimulus for discussion of these issues in addition to the issue of the responsibilities of engineers to society and the directions that society should take.&#148; by Bernhardt Trout, Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering.

<br><i>Myth-making and the State in Medieval and Renaissance Venice</i><br>

&#147;This illustrated and interactive talk will be about the use of myth
to enhance a state's power.  Although my extended example will be
medieval and renaissance venice, the story applies to most states,
including the US.  We will examine how myth is elaborated, and then
how it is used by the state to perpetuate itself, to impress others,
and to maintain control over its citizens. Finally we will see if we
can draw any useful conclusions from the venetian story for our own
situation.&#148 by Arthur Steinber, Professor of Anthropology and Director of ISP.
