<br><i>Myth-making and the State in Medieval and Renaissance Venice</i><br>

&#147;This illustrated and interactive talk will be about the use of myth
to enhance a state's power.  Although my extended example will be
medieval and renaissance venice, the story applies to most states,
including the US.  We will examine how myth is elaborated, and then
how it is used by the state to perpetuate itself, to impress others,
and to maintain control over its citizens. Finally we will see if we
can draw any useful conclusions from the venetian story for our own
situation.&#148 by Arthur Steinber, Professor of Anthropology and Director of ISP.
