<b>Human Spaceflight: Space Stations to Mars</b><br><i><a href="http://web.mit.edu/aeroastro/www/people/dnewman/bio.html">Dava Newman, Ph.D</a>  Associate Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Macvicar Faculty Fellow</i>
</i><br>
<p>
This seminar highlights astronaut activities on a space station as well as
preparations for a human mission to Mars. The Enhanced Dynamic Load Sensors
(EDLS) spaceflight experiment flew on the Mir space station from 1996-1998
during a cooperative venture with Russia, which provided research
opportunities for the U.S. on the Russian Space Station Mir. Seven U.S.
astronauts stayed on Mir between March 1995 and June 1998. The EDLS
experiment is the latest and most comprehensive study of the disturbance
forces and moments induced by the astronauts during normal on-orbit
activities. Currently the International Space Station is being assembled and is inhabited by three crewmembers during long-duration (3 month) missions.
<p>

After investigating how astronauts move and float around the weightless
environment of a space station, the challenge for the next millenium will
be a human mission to Mars. How will astronauts perform on their multi-year
journey to the Martian surface in search for the evidence of life?
<p>

During the six-month long flight from Earth to Mars, astronauts will
undergo 20-30% muscle atrophy and lose bone at the rate of 1-2% per month. What are the appropriate physiological countermeasures to ensure that
planetary astronauts can egress their spacecraft and perform useful work in
their locomotion spacesuits during their 600-day stay on the surface of
Mars in a 3/8-g environment? The most stressful aspect of the mission is yet to come, namely, a return trip to Earth in a microgravity spacecraft and then re-introducing Earth's 1-g environment to a musculoskeletal system adapted for planetary exploration.
<p>

The answers to these questions lie in scientific studies investigating how
humans move and adapt in familiar (1-g) and altered environments
(partial-gravity). We are children of gravity. We can't see it or touch it,
but it has guided the evolutionary destiny of every plant and animal
species, and has dictated the size and shape or our organs and limbs. Every
bone and muscle is aligned to maximize mobility in 1-g. Investigations that
reveal astronaut performance in partial gravity environments are discussed.

<b>The Airline Industry: Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow</b> <br><i><a href="http://web.mit.edu/johnpaul/www/">John-Paul Clarke, Sc.D.</a> Assistant Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics 
</i>

<br>
The airline industry is an integral part of life in the United 
States.  Close to 10% of the U.S. GDP is directly or indirectly 
related to the industry and, many argue that the percentage of 
economic production that is facilitated by the extensive high speed 
transportation network that the industry provides is even higher. 
<p>
This presentation will (a) review the history of the airline 
industry, (b) outline some of the reasons why carriers have developed 
hub-and-spoke networks and frequent flyer programs, (c) discuss the 
technical challenges faced by the airlines and by air traffic control 
as they try to meet demand and maintain/improve safety, and (d) 
present some potential future scenarios for the industry.

<b>The Pebble Bed Modular Reactor</b> <br><i><a href= "http://web.mit.edu/ned/www/academics/faculty/kadak.html">Andrew C.Kadak, Ph.D.</a>, 
Professor of the Practice of Nuclear Engineering</i>
<br>
With energy again an issue of domestic and international importance, the Nuclear Engineering Department at MIT has been quietly working on a technology that it hopes will meet the challenge of providing a clean, safe, and reliable source of electricity.  What started in January 1998 as an IAP project has blossomed into a full design effort whose goal is a nuclear plant that can compete with natural gas, be meltdown proof, and have a waste form that can be disposed of without reprocessing.
<br>
The technology of choce was a high temperature helium cooled, gas turbine powered, modular pebble bed reactor originally developed in Germany in the late 70's and 80's.  The MIT design team is takin ga fresh look at all aspects of the technology, from factory manufacture and site assembly to advanced fuel designs, safety analyses, modularity features that allow the entire plant to be shipped by truck and advanced instrumentation and control systems.  This technology was mentioned in the Bush national energy plan as an example of the type of fresh thinking needed for the future.
<p>
 Professor Kadak and this reactor were featured in the cover article of the August 2001 issue of Popular Science.  Professor Kadak previously served as the President of the American Nuclear Society and the CEO of Yankee Atomic Electric Company.
