<h1>This Semester's Schedule</h1>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Thursday, April 3, 2003</strong> <br>
    <strong>Topic: Cosmic Inflation and the Accelerating Universe
</strong><br>
    <i>Professor Alan Guth, V F Weisskopf Professor Of Physics</i>
    <p>Inflationary cosmology offers possible explanations for many
     features of our universe, including its uniformity, its mass
     density, and the faint ripples that are now being observed in the
     cosmic background radiation.  The recently discovered
     acceleration of the universe has radically altered our picture of
     the universe, but has also helped to confirm the basic
     predictions of inflation.
<p>

ALAN H. GUTH is the Victor F. Weisskopf Professor of Physics
     and a Margaret MacVicar Faculty Fellow at the Massachusetts
     Institute of Technology.  Trained in particle theory at MIT,
     Guth held postdoctoral positions at Princeton, Columbia,
     Cornell, and SLAC before returning to MIT as a faculty
     member in 1980.  His work in cosmology began at Cornell,
     when Henry Tye persuaded him to study the production of
     magnetic monopoles in the early universe.  Using standard
     assumptions, they found that far too many would be produced. 
     Continuing this work at SLAC, Guth discovered that the
     magnetic monopole glut could be avoided by a new proposal
     which he called the inflationary universe.  Guth is a member
     of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy
     of Arts and Sciences, and had been awarded the Franklin
     Medal for Physics of the Franklin Institute and the Dirac Prize
     of the International Center for Theoretical Physics.
          Guth is still busy exploring the consequences of
     inflation.  He has also written a popular-level book called
     "The Inflationary Universe: The Quest for a New Theory of
     Cosmic Origins" (Addison-Wesley/Perseus Books, 1997).

<li> <strong> Monday, May 5, 2003 </strong> <br>	
	<strong> Topic: Depression </strong> <br>
	
     <i> Professor Eric Feron, Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics </i>
<p>
Depression is an illness that can considerably affect an individual's mind 
and spirit. As such, the MIT community, and MIT students in particular, can 
suffer considerably from the effects of depression, since it touches what 
makes us strong in the first place.

In this talk/discussion, I will present a candid view of depression, its 
symptoms, its consequences on personal and professional life, and how to 
get out of it. I will draw from my own experience to describe these various 
points. I will also try and give practical advice about how depression can 
be dealt with effectively.

<p>
ERIC FERON is an Associate Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 
at MIT since 1993. He is the happy father of three kids and busy advisor to 
an unknown but large number of undergraduate and graduate students. His 
hobbies include collecting old science books and XVIIIth century French 
furniture, sailing and skiing.
