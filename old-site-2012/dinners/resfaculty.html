<h1>TBP Member Student Reservation Form</h1>

<p>Please check our <a href="schedule.html">schedule</a> for dinners and list your choices below.

<h2>New Reservation Policy</h2>

<p>Please notify us at least three business days in advance if you need 
to cancel your reservation (failure to do so may result in the cancellation 
of future reservations and/or a fine to cover the cost of the dinner). If you 
submit this form more
than once, your new information will replace information from previous
submissions. Please indicate that you are resubmitting the form in the Notes section of the form.
If you have any questions on the reservation policy or about the Leonardo
dinners, please email <a href="mailto:tbp-leonardo">tbp-leonardo</a>.

<p>We expect that all members attend all dinners for which they have
reservations and that they dress appropriately for each dinner (that is in
semi-formal business attire). Neglecting to do either of these may result
in the cancellation of any future dinner reservations and/or a fine to cover
the cost of the dinner.
