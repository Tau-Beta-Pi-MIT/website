Leonardo Dinner Web Pages

When changing the schedule, first, move the old schedule into
schedules-previous/ if you are starting a new term.

The dinner options need to be changed in resmembers.html and resfaculty.html
each time you add a new dinner.
The dinner options are in the <option> tags of the <select> menus for each
preference level.
