          <!--
<p class='text'>If you have been invited to become a TBP eligible, the following requirements must be fulfilled:</p>
          <p class='text'>
            <ol>
              <li><em><b>Personal Integrity</b></em><br /> 
              Basically, if we hear of you doing anything that could compromise your personal integrity, we may reconsider your eligibility for initiation.
              </li>
              <li><em><b>10 service hours</b></em><br />
              You have to complete all of these hours with TBP. You can complete service hours by attending a Da Vinci dinner (each dinner counts for one hour) or by helping out with other TBP activities and committees. There will be emails sent out, as well as an updated calendar of upcoming events <a href='http://web.mit.edu/tbp/www/events.shtml' target='new'>here</a>.
              </li>
              <li><em><b>Attend at least two social events</b></em><br /> 
              Check your emails for news on these events, as well as the <a href='http://web.mit.edu/tbp/www/events.shtml' target='new'>calendar</a>.
              </li>
              <li><em><b>Recommendation letter</b></em><br />
              This will be from someone who knows you well (or what you would consider "well enough") and has a supervisor position over you; it can be a mentor, a professor, a UROP supervisor, a pastor, a sports coach, etc., just not your parents or your peers. The contents of the recommendation letter don't have to follow a specific formula, but basically the letter must attest to your personal character and integrity.<br />
              How to email us: Tell your recommender to email <a href='mailtot:tbp-eligibles-chair@mit.edu'>tbp-eligibles-chair@mit.edu</a> (no attachments necessary) with subject title "TBP Recommendation Letter for FirstName LastName"
              </li>
              <li><em><b>Personal essay</b></em><br />
              The essay should be ~500 words (in 12pt font). You may talk about one of two things:
                <ol type="a">
                  <li>Write about a time that you faced a moral dilemma and what you did - Don't write superficially on this. Please say more than "I wanted to cheat on my X.0XX exam but I didn't. I'm done =)" It's fine to talk about if you were confronted with that particular dilemma, but at least talk about it more; give some background, give some context. Write something substantive. That's all we're asking for.</li>
                  <li>Talk about the most unforgettable experience you've ever had.</li>
                </ol>
              You may submit your essay <a href='http://web.mit.edu/tbp/www/eligibles.shtml#personalessay' target='new'>here</a>.
              </li>
