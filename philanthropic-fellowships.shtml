<h1>Philanthropic Fellowships</h1><br>
<p>This year, Tau Beta Pi will also be awarding Philanthropic
Fellowships, aimed towards recognized MIT student groups that are
seeking to increase involvement and raise awareness about their
volunteering activities. The sponsored philanthropies may be based in
the U.S. or abroad, and there are no restrictions regarding the type
of volunteering activities proposed by the student group. Applications
for these fellowships are due on March 16th 2013. This spring, we are
seeking to award up to 5 fellowships with up to US $3000 each.</p>
