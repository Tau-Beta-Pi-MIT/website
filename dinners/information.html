<p>As stated in the preamble to our constitution, one of the major goals 
of Tau Beta Pi, the National Engineering Honor Society, is &quot;to foster
a spirit of liberal culture at engineering colleges.&quot; Towards this end, 
the MIT chapter of Tau Beta Pi is pleased to host a series of dinner
lectures, the TBP Leonardo da Vinci Dinners. MIT faculty members and
TBP students from a wide variety of departments are invited to each
dinner to enjoy good food, listen to an interesting presentation on a
variety of topics, and engage in hearty conversation in the spirit of
Leonardo da Vinci: artist, architect, engineer, scientist, and
philosopher. It is our hope that by bringing together people from many
different fields we can foster the kind of intellectual diversity and
love of knowledge exemplified by Leonardo and representative of Tau
Beta Pi.

<p>These elegant dinners bring together about twenty TBP members and
several faculty members. Each dinner begins at 6:00 PM and lasts
approximately two hours. One of the faculty members gives a short
presentation which acts as a catalyst for conversation during
dinner. The presentations are meant to confront us with relevant
issues of science, society, and culture: in short, to foster a spirit
of liberal culture here at MIT. Dinner is provided free of charge to
all guests.
