<strong>The Dual Corporate Ladder and New Hires in the Corporate World</strong><br>
<em>Professor Thomas Allen, Howard W. Johnson Professor of Management</em><br>

<p>Prof Allen will talk about the dual corporate ladder, which has been used 
by many companies to recruit engineers.  He will discuss whether the dual 
corporate ladder really exists, if it is actually effective, and its 
implications for engineers in corporations.  He will also discuss the 
role, expectations, treatment, and training of new hires in the corporate 
world and the way these things affect the employees and the company.

<p>Prof Allen specializes in organizational psychology and management. He 
explores the relationship between organizational structure and behavior, 
the role of technological gatekeepers in technology transfer, and the 
influence of architectural layout on communication. Prof Allen also 
examines international technology transfer, reward systems for technical 
professionals, and the impact of organizational structure on project 
performance. His long-term research targets the pharmaceutical and 
aerospace industries, addressing principally the issue of project management.

<strong>Presentation of Photo-Journal Documenting a 2-Week Trip to Bali, Indonesia</strong><br>
<em>Samuel Jay Keyser, MIT Peter de Florez Professor Emeritus of Linguistics</em><br><em>joined by his spouse, Nancy Kelly</em><br>

<p>Join us as Professor Keyser and his wife present 
the photographic record of their trip to Bali, Indonesia this past April.

<p>Professor Keyser is editor-in-chief of Linguistic Inquiry, a major
   journal in the field of theoretical linguistics as well as an
   associated monograph and book series. Jay has published one books of
   poem and an children's book, On the Horizon, is scheduled for
   publication in the Fall of next year. An excerpt from his
   Malawi/Zambia safari journal appeared in the May 2000 issue of 
   &quot;The Atlantic Monthly.&quot;

   <p>Professor Keyser will be joined by his spouse Nancy Kelly. Nancy is an
   inveterate traveler and an accomplished photographer who has recorded
   several trips with Jay.  She has been a member of the MIT Office of
   the President for three decades, currently as Administrative Officer.
   Below are her comments about her two passions - travel and
   photography:
   
   <p class="quote">&quot;I must have been born with a travel gene.  I remember dreaming about
   exploring different parts of the world by the time I was eight years
   old.
   That was the year my mother began managing a seasonal inn on the coast
   of
   North Carolina, my home state.  Each summer, guests came from around
   the
   country and different parts of the world, and I couldn't wait to quiz
   them
   about where they were from, how far away it was, and what it was like
   there.  I began compiling a mental list of places to explore, one that
   grew
   longer each summer.

<p class="quote">&quot;I have been traveling ever since, with a camera as my constant
   companion.
   I love to observe people, places, objects, animals, most everything
   through
   a camera lens and record them on film.  It helps me see more clearly
   and
   differently.  I discover patterns and shapes that aren't there if I'm
   cameraless.  I capture for a lifetime smiles, looks, and events that
   last
   an instant.  Best of all, when I've forgotten some small detail or
   precious
   moment that made an adventure special, all I have to do is look back
      through my photographs to bring the memories flooding back to the
   surface
   so I can relive the experience all over again.

<p class="quote">&quot;Photography is the way I travel when the demands of daily living 
   keep me
   inside, looking out the window and wondering when the signs will be
   favorable for my next adventure.  My exploration list continues to
   grow each year.&quot;
