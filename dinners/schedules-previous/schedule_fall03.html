<!--    <strong>Topic: Cosmic Inflation and the Accelerating Universe
</strong><br> -->
    <i>Professor Rahul Sarpeshkar </i>
    <p>
Neurobiological systems use impressively few resources of energy, space, and time to solve complex sensory and sensorimotor tasks. An important reason for such efficiency is the clever use of nonlinear, adaptive, distributed, and hybrid analog-digital computational strategies. First, I will describe ongoing research on building high-performance, ultra-low-power bionic-ear processors inspired by the biological cochlea. Then, I describe why the optimal strategy for efficient computation is likely to be a hybrid mixture of analog and digital computation. I conclude by outlining research on building energy-efficient architectures that are inspired by pulsatile analog-digital representations in the brain's neurons. 
<p>

RAHUL SARPESHKAR obtained Bachelor_s degrees in Electrical Engineering and Physics at MIT in 1990. After completing his PhD at Caltech, he joined Bell Labs as a member of the technical staff. Since 1999, he has been on the faculty of MIT's Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department where he heads a research group on Analog VLSI and Biological Systems, and is currently the Robert J. Shillman Associate Professor. He has received several awards including the Packard Fellow award given to outstanding young faculty, the ONR Young Investigator Award, and the NSF Career Award. He was recently awarded the Junior Bose Award for Excellence in Teaching from the department of EECS. He holds over a dozen patents and has authored several publications including one that was featured on the cover of NATURE. His research interests include analog and mixed-signal VLSI, ultra low power circuits and systems, biologically inspired circuits and systems, and control theory.

  <strong>Topic: Saving Venice
</strong><br>
    <i>Professor Paola Rizzoli </i>
    <p>

For centuries, the beautiful city of Venice has faced increasingly
urgent flooding problems. Most recently, rising sea levels have
dramatically increased the frequency of floodings. As a result, Venice
is now under water for about one third of the year. After three
decades of discussion and debate, a solution has been reached in the
form of a $4 billion public works project: massive floodgates designed
to swing closed will be built at the three inlets to the lagoon
surrounding the city, protecting it from onslaughts of water brought
on by tides and storms.
<p>
This talk will describe both the scientific problems facing Venice and the engineering solution. The lecture will be highlighted by photographs depicting the severe flooding that has plagued Venice, as well as the beautiful and historic landmarks that make the city so very worth saving.

<p>
The circulation of the water in an ocean basin is highly complex. It depends
upon the shape of the basin, temperatures of the air and the water, prevailing
winds and storms in addition to the rotation of the Earth. These interactions,
and most importantly the interactions with the atmosphere, lead to large scale
phenomena like El Nino and the North Atlantic oscillations, among others,
which in turn can have major effects on our climate. PAOLA RIZZOLI is one of
the premier scientists to model such circulation. She applies a strong Physics
and Math background to understand and ultimately to predict the changes in
ocean circulation. Her first interest was to model the regular and dangerous
flooding under varying meteorological conditions in Venice in her native
country of Italy. She expanded these studies to investigate the dynamics of
strong oceanographic and meteorological flow structures with long lives like
hurricanes, and their effects on general ocean circulation. These features
violate the principles of "chaos", the intrinsic unpredictability of ocean and
meteorological flow structures. This research was motivated by the work of
Edward Lorenz, the developer of chaos theory, who, together with Jule Charney,
brought her to MIT in 1981.
<p> Paola Rizzoli's research then expanded to model general ocean circulation from
the global scale to the ocean basin scale. For example, she has been modeling
circulation in the Atlantic Ocean, which is a crucial component for modeling
the climate system of the Earth, with focus on the Gulf Stream system in
the '80s-early '90s and more recently on the tropical/subtropical interactions
affecting the equatorial Atlantic. She also models marginal seas like the
Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea as a subcomponent of these general
circulation models. These local circulation models have major implications for
the development of local ecosystems and the flora and fauna that inhabit them.
This physical/biochemical modeling is especially crucial to understand and
predict the behavior of the Black Sea ecosystem which constitutes an extreme
example of human-induced eutrophication. Finally, she does research in data
collection and assimilation of all available observations for "model data
synthesis" for numerical circulation models.
<p>
Paola Rizzoli was born on April 18, 1946 in Lonigo, Italy. She attended Lyceum
Benedetti in Venice, Italy where she earned a Bachelor of Science degree in
Physics and Mathematics with highest honors in 1963. She attended graduate
school at the University of Padua, Italy where she earned a Ph.D. in Physics,
summa cum laude in 1968. She completed a one-year post-doctoral fellowship at
the University of Padua in 1969 before joining the Istituto Dinamica Grandi
Masse which was created by the Italian National Research Council the next
year. She achieved the rank of Senior Scientist by 1976. In 1971, she became a
regular commuter with the Scripps Institute of Oceanography at the University
of California at San Diego. She was there a visiting scientist in the period
1971-1974 and she started her Ph.D. in physical oceanography at the end of
1974, completing it in 1978. She then accepted the position of Cecil and Ida
Green Scholar at the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at the
University of California at San Diego while on leave from the Istituto
Dinamica Grandi Masse. In 1981, she joined the faculty at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in Cambridge where she remains today. Since 1997,
Rizzoli has served as Director of the Joint Program in Oceanography and Ocean
Engineering between Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution. Paola Rizzoli married Peter Stone in 1987.
Paola Rizzoli is leading a very productive career. She is an author of 97
articles in refereed international journals, and the editor, or co-editor, of
nine professional volumes, apart from publications in Italian and governmental
reports. Many of these papers are seminal works on the modeling of ocean
circulation. She received 9 honors and fellowships including the Masi Price in
1998, bestowed by the Italian Ministry of Culture and Education which is
assigned to Italian citizens who have distinguished themselves internationally
in arts, literature and science.
<p>Rizzoli has performed significant service to the profession. She served as
President (1999-2003) and Deputy Secretary (1995-1999) for the International
Association for the Physical Sciences of the Ocean (IAPSO) in addition to many
other committees and panels. She was also President of the Committee on
Physical Oceanography of the CIESM (International Exploration of the
Mediterranean Sea) (1984-1988) and President of the Italian Commission to
Assign University Chairs in the Physics of the Earth (1991-1992). She also
served on numerous committees and panels for the National Center for
Atmospheric Research, the American Meteorological Society, Institute of Naval
Oceanography, National Centers for Environmental Prediction, Goddard Space
Flight Center, UNESCO, and the National Science Foundation. She is presently
also an Editor for the Journal of Geophysical Research among other editorial
positions.

  <strong>Topic: The Tulsa Race Riot of 1921 and the Question of Reparations
</strong><br>
    <i>Professor Christopher Capozzola </i>
    <p>

On May 31 and June 1, 1921, a violent mob destroyed the
African-American neighborhood of Tulsa, Oklahoma, destroying nearly
35 blocks and causing as many as 300 deaths. The riot was little
spoken of in the intervening years, but is now the focus of an
intense debate over the responsibility of the state of Oklahoma and
the question of whether the riot's few remaining survivors have a
right to claim reparations.  This talk will give a history of the
riot and the present-day debates in the political arena and the
courts, and will also give us a chance to discuss the place of
historical memory in contemporary American politics.

<p>

Christopher Capozzola specializes in the political and cultural
history of the United States from 1861 to 1945. He completed his
Ph.D. at Columbia University in 2002. He has held fellowships from the
Social Science Research Council, the American Historical Association,
and the Sophia Smith Collection at Smith College. He has previously
taught at Columbia University and Middlebury College; at MIT, he
teaches courses in political and legal history, cultural history, and
the history of race, gender, and class.

Professor Capozzola's research interests are in the history of war and
politics in everyday life. He is currently working on a book based on
his dissertation, "Uncle Sam Wants You: Political Obligations in World
War I America." Based on the records of groups such as draft boards,
labor unions, immigrant societies, and women's clubs, the book
combines social history and political theory to explore American
political culture in the early twentieth century. An article based on
his dissertation won the Louis Pelzer Memorial Award of the
Organization of American Historians in 2001.

He has published essays and reviews in American Quarterly, the Journal
of American History, and Radical History Review, as well as in popular
periodicals including The Nation, The Progressive, and The Boston
Globe.




  <li><strong><i>CANCELLED</i> - Thursday, December 4, 2003</strong> <br>
  <strong>Topic: Is Education a Service? 
</strong><br> 
    <i><a href=" http://www-me.mit.edu/people/personal/sesarma.htm">Professor Sanjay Sarma</a></i>
    <p>

"Is education a service like, say, dry-cleaning? Or is it 
different? Should there be money-back guarantees? Should teachers do the 
grading of their own courses, or should someone else do the grading? I 
will explore these ideas in an interactive way and present a view of how 
colleges might be run in the future."
